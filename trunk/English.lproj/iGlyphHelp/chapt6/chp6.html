			<br>
			#K6.1. The Navigation Bar<br>
			<br>
			On the left-hand side of the foot-bar you will find the navigation bar, which enables you to create and work with multipage documents (Alternativly you may use the navigate menu).<br>

			Page Navigation:<br>
			a: First Page (Control-PageDown)<br>
			b: Previous Page (PageDown)<br>
			c: Go to Page<br>
			d: Next Page (PageUp)<br>
			e: Last Page (Control-PageUp)<br>
			<br>
			Other Page Functions:<br>
			f: Delete Current Page (Control-D)<br>
			g: Insert Page before the Current Page (Control-I)<br>
			h: Append Page at the End of the Document (Control-A)<br>
			<br>
			To jump to a specific page the user has to type a page number into the textfield (Fig.6.1c). After pressing [Enter] the program will jump to the specified page.<br>
			<br>
			#K6.2. Page Sections<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm69.WMF}<br>
			Fig.6.2<br>
			<br>
			A page is divided into three sections:<br>
			<br>
			a: Header (head bar)<br>
			b: Footer (foot-bar)<br>
			c: Writing area<br>
			<br>
			These sections have a similar significance to those of a word processor. All objects placed within the head or foot section will appear on all pages, whereas objects in section c will appear only on the page on which they had been placed. The difference from a word processor is that the user can freely move objects across the sections. If the A3 pageformat is defined the head bar and foot-bar extend over the two A4 pages.<br>
			You will mainly use the head bar and foot-bar to place the page number and title on it.</p>
