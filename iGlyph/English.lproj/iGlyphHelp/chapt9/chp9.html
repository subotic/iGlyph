		<p>9. File Functions<br>
			<br>
			Most of the programs working with files offer basic file functions in a &lt;File&gt; menu. VisualGlyph has the same menu (Fig.9.1):<br>
			<br>
			- New (Create a new file)<br>
			- Open (Open an existing file)<br>
			- Save (Save a currently open file)<br>
			- Save as (Save a currently open file under a different name)<br>
			- Quit (Close the program)<br>
			- Example.IG (this is the name of the previously loaded file. A click on this line reloads that file)<br>
			<br>

			Fig.9.1<br>
			<br>
			In order to open a IG-document that already exists, click on the menu item &lt;Open&gt;. The window standard dialog appears and you can select a file. VisualGlyph creates Files with the extension &lt;.IG&gt;.<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			The &lt;Print&gt; Dialog has three options:<br>
			<br>
			- Print all pages of the document<br>
			- Print from page x to page y<br>
			- Print the current page<br>
			- Print multiselected objects<br>
			<br>
			At the bottom of the print-dialog you can see the currently selected printer.  By clicking on &lt;Select Printer&gt; you can select a different printer (Fig.9.3b). <br>
