		<p>7. The Clipboard  <br>
			<br>
			#K7.1. The Clipboard in VisualGlyph<br>
			<br>
			With the help of the clipboard you can either export data to another program or delete, move or copy objects within VisualGlyph. Before using the clipboard function you have to multiselect objects (see 5.6 and also 4.4.1)  (drag a frame, not merely click on an object - even if, for example, only one sign or a void cartouche is selected) (Fig.7.1a).<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm70.WMF}<br>
			Fig.7.1<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			You can either select &lt;Cut&gt; or &lt;Copy&gt;. Both actions will send the selected objects to the clipboard. From this point on, the menu &lt;Paste&gt; becomes active. The destination of the paste action is determined by the blinking cursor which can now be positioned on a page different than the current one. Fig.7.1b shows the result. Here the cursor is here covered by the blue handle. <br>
			<br>
			#K7.2. Export Data to Word Processors etc.<br>
			<br>
			In order to export the selected items, click on &lt;Copy as WMF (Word etc.)&gt;. The objects are now converted to the WMF (Window Meta File) format which can be read by nearly all Word-processors. WMF is a vector-orientated format whose great advantage is scalability.  The scale can be changed by clicking in the middle of the graphic; a frame with control points will appear, and by dragging the arrows the graphic can be resized.<br>
			<br>
			Obs.: In Word you will mostly want to paste objects within a body of typescript. To perform this function use &lt;Paste Special&gt; (Menu: Edit). The action and its settings are shown here for Word 8:<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm71.WMF}<br>
			Fig.7.2 <br>
			<br>
			If you select the menu: &lt;Edit / Paste Special&gt; a dialog appears. Use the settings shown in Fig.7.2 and click on &lt;OK&gt;.<br>
			<br>
			Sign Cutting<br>
			<br>
			The user can export every object. Hieroglphs are exported in a special way. When selected, they are (as well as other objects) surrounded by a blue dashed frame, which marks their outer limits exactly (Fig.7.3a).<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm72.WMF}<br>
			Fig.7.3<br>
			<br>
			When pasted into Word the area around the signs is enlarged at the left, right and top-hand side. This avoids the risk of cutting signs. But depending on the version of Word this might anyway occur:<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm73.WMF}<br>
			Fig.7.4<br>
			<br>
			In such a case the user can alter the size of the surrounding frame manually :<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm74.WMF}<br>
			Fig.7.5<br>
			<br>
			The upper and lower frame lines are set in the same way with the UpArrow and DownArrow. When the frame is set manually, the program will use its defined size and not calculate it as shown in Fig.7.3b, e.g.:<br>
			<br>
			{bmc bm75.WMF}<br>
			Fig.7.6<br>
			<br>
			If the frame is correctly defined signs are no longer cut.</p>
